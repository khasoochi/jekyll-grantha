      <p>Krishna addresses Arjuna's despondency by questioning its source and appropriateness. The word "anārya" (un-Aryan) suggests behavior unworthy of a noble person. This is not merely about social standing but about spiritual nobility and adherence to dharma.</p>

      <p>The three criticisms - that it is un-Aryan, does not lead to heaven, and brings disgrace - address different aspects: spiritual, metaphysical, and social respectively. Krishna is using multiple arguments to shake Arjuna from his state of confusion.</p>

      <p><strong>This is one of the most famous verses in the Bhagavad Gītā</strong>, encapsulating the essence of Karma Yoga.</p>

      <p>The verse contains four key instructions:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Karmaṇy-evādhikāras te</strong> - Your right is to action alone. This establishes that our domain of control is limited to our actions, not their results.</li>

        <li><strong>Mā phaleṣu kadācana</strong> - Never to the fruits. We have no claim over the results, which are determined by numerous factors beyond our control.</li>

        <li><strong>Mā karma-phala-hetur bhūḥ</strong> - Do not be motivated by the fruits of action. Our motivation should come from duty (dharma) rather than anticipated rewards.</li>

        <li><strong>Mā te saṅgo'stv akarmaṇi</strong> - Nor let your attachment be to inaction. This prevents the opposite extreme of abandoning action altogether.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Śaṅkara explains that this verse addresses both the householder engaged in worldly duties and the renunciate pursuing knowledge. For the former, it teaches right action; for the latter, it guards against laziness disguised as renunciation.</p>

      <p>The verse establishes a middle path between attachment to fruits (which binds us to saṃsāra) and complete inaction (which violates our nature and duty). This is the foundation of Karma Yoga - performing action without attachment to results.</p>

      <p>This concluding verse of the chapter summarizes the state of the sthita-prajña (one of steady wisdom) described throughout. The "brāhmī sthiti" is the state of abiding in the knowledge of Brahman.</p>

      <p>The verse assures us that once this state is attained, there is no falling back into delusion. This is because true knowledge, unlike mere intellectual understanding, transforms one's very being.</p>

      <p>The reference to "anta-kāle" (time of death) addresses a common concern: even if one attains this state briefly, being established in it at death ensures liberation. This connects to the teaching in later chapters about remembering the Divine at the moment of death.</p>

## Chapter Summary

This chapter, known as Sāṅkhyayoga, contains 72 verses and forms the philosophical foundation of the Gītā's teaching. Krishna addresses Arjuna's despondency and introduces fundamental concepts:

1. **The Immortality of the Soul** (verses 11-30): The self (ātman) is eternal and indestructible
2. **Karma Yoga** (verses 31-53): The path of selfless action without attachment to fruits
3. **The Sthita-prajña** (verses 54-72): Description of the person of steady wisdom

The chapter transitions from Arjuna's emotional crisis to profound spiritual teaching, setting the stage for the entire Gītā.
