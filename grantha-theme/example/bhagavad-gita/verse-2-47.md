      This verse encapsulates the essence of Karma Yoga, the yoga of selfless action. Śaṅkara explains that this teaching addresses both the householder engaged in worldly duties and the renunciate pursuing knowledge.

      ## Analysis of the Verse

      The verse contains four key instructions:

      **1. Karmaṇy-evādhikāras te** - Your right is to action alone

      This establishes that our domain of control is limited to our actions, not their results. The word "eva" (only) emphasizes the exclusivity of this right.

      **2. Mā phaleṣu kadācana** - Never to the fruits

      We have no claim over the results, which are determined by numerous factors beyond our control including past karma, divine will, and the cooperation of others.

      **3. Mā karma-phala-hetur bhūḥ** - Do not be motivated by the fruits of action

      Our motivation should come from duty (dharma) rather than anticipated rewards. This transforms work from bondage to liberation.

      **4. Mā te saṅgo'stv akarmaṇi** - Nor let your attachment be to inaction

      This prevents the opposite extreme of abandoning action altogether. Even renunciates must engage in necessary activities.

      ## Śaṅkara's Commentary

      Śaṅkara addresses a potential objection: if we have no right to fruits, why act at all? He explains that:

      1. Action is natural to all beings - complete inaction is impossible while embodied
      2. Prescribed duties (svadharma) must be performed to maintain cosmic order
      3. Action without attachment purifies the mind, preparing it for knowledge
      4. For the realized person, action continues but without any sense of doership

      The verse establishes a middle path between:
      - Attachment to fruits (which binds us to saṃsāra)
      - Complete inaction (which violates our nature and duty)

      This is the foundation of Karma Yoga - performing action without attachment to results, offering all actions to the Divine.

      Madhusūdana Sarasvatī elaborates on how this verse reconciles action and renunciation. He explains that "adhikāra" (right/authority) in action means we have the power and responsibility to act, but not to determine outcomes.

      He compares this to a farmer who has the right to plow and sow, but not to command the rain or control the harvest. Similarly, we must do our duty without demanding specific results.

      The prohibition against attachment to inaction is particularly important for those on the spiritual path, as spiritual pride can lead one to abandon duties under the guise of renunciation.

      Swami Chinmayananda explains this verse in practical terms for modern life:

      "This verse is not asking us to work without any goal or purpose. Planning and intelligent effort are necessary. What it warns against is emotional attachment to results and the anxiety that comes from feeling we alone are responsible for outcomes.

      In modern terms:
      - Do your best in your studies or work
      - Plan intelligently and work diligently
      - But remain calm whether you succeed or fail
      - Don't let success inflate your ego or failure depress you
      - Keep working without being paralyzed by fear of failure

      This attitude makes us more effective, not less. Anxiety and attachment to results actually hamper our performance. A calm, focused mind works better than an agitated, worried one.

      The verse is teaching us skillful living - how to be fully engaged in life while remaining inwardly free."
